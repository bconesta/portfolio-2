# My portfolio repository

This project was coded using React.js and sass. It is intented to be the place where you can see all about me and my projects. Not only web developments but also my electrical and mechanical ones.

### Why using React?

I know that using React for static pages like this one might seem pointless, but I just wanted to be able to divide the code in diferent components. This way, the code looks cleaner and it is easier to add new content on it.
